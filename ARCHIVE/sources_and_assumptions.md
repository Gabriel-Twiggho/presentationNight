## AI Revenue Apportionment Methods

### Public Companies
- **Nvidia:** Data Center segment revenue used directly (100% AI-attributable)
- **Microsoft:** Intelligent Cloud segment, AI-attributable portion estimated at 40-48% based on Azure AI services growth
- **Oracle:** Cloud Infrastructure segment, AI-attributable portion estimated at 30-45% based on AI workload growth
- **AMD:** Data Center segment, AI-attributable portion estimated at 35-50% based on AI chip sales
- **Intel:** Data Center segment, AI-attributable portion estimated at 24-27% based on AI workload trends

### Private Companies
- **Pure-play AI companies (OpenAI, CoreWeave, Nebius, xAI, etc.):** 100% AI-attributable
- **AI-focused startups (Figure AI, Mistral, etc.):** 100% AI-attributable

## Ownership and Consolidation Policy

- **Default Consolidation:** Sum of full EVs (full ownership assumed)
- **Pro-rata adjustments:** Not applied in default consolidation (Microsoft's stake in OpenAI, Nvidia's stake in Intel, etc. are not adjusted)
- **Double-count flags:** No subsidiaries identified that would cause double-counting (all companies report standalone)

## Materiality Decisions for Network Expansion

- **1-degree relationships included:** All direct relationships from seed companies meeting materiality threshold (>$500M or >1% revenue)
- **2-degree relationships:** Not expanded beyond 1 degree as intermediate relationships did not meet materiality thresholds
- **Excluded companies:** Meta (Nebius customer) excluded as relationship is external to bubble

## Benchmark Comparators

- **Big Tech EV/Revenue (2025):** ~8-12x (Microsoft, Google, Amazon average)
- **Enterprise Software EV/Revenue (2025):** ~10-15x
- **AI Bubble EV/Revenue (2025 LTM Full):** 14.04x
- **AI Bubble EV/Revenue (2025 LTM AI-Attributable):** 15.91x
- **Interpretation:** Bubble trades at premium to Big Tech but within range of high-growth enterprise software multiples

## High-Uncertainty Items (>5% of Consolidated Totals)

1. **OpenAI 2025 LTM Revenue:** $12B estimate drives ~2.3% of consolidated revenue
2. **CoreWeave 2025 LTM EV:** $70B estimate drives ~1.0% of consolidated EV
3. **Internal revenue removal estimates:** $9.8B removal in 2025 LTM affects consolidated revenue by ~1.9%
