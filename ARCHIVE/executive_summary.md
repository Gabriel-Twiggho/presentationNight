# Executive Summary: AI Bubble Financial Analysis

## Consolidated Financial Overview (2025 LTM to September 30, 2025)

The AI bubble, comprising 15 core companies and their direct relationships, demonstrates robust growth with consolidated outside revenue of $510.3 billion and enterprise value of $7.17 trillion for the latest twelve months ending September 30, 2025. The EV/Revenue multiple of 14.04x (full-company) and 15.91x (AI-attributable) indicates the bubble trades at a premium to Big Tech averages (8-12x) but within the range of high-growth enterprise software multiples (10-15x).

## Growth Trajectory

Revenue growth has accelerated from 19.3% in 2024 to 14.3% in 2025 LTM, while EV growth has moderated from 21.9% to 19.1% over the same period. Notably, AI-attributable revenue growth remains strong at 26.4% in 2025 LTM, suggesting the AI segment is driving disproportionate value creation. Microsoft and Nvidia dominate the bubble, contributing 48.8% and 18.6% of consolidated outside revenue respectively, while Microsoft's $3.85 trillion EV represents 53.7% of total enterprise value.

## Valuation Assessment

The consolidated bubble appears reasonably valued relative to revenue, with EV growing slightly faster than revenue (19.1% vs 14.3% in 2025 LTM). However, this masks significant dispersion: public companies trade at more moderate multiples while private companies like OpenAI ($300B EV, $12B revenue = 25x) and CoreWeave ($70B EV, $3.5B revenue = 20x) command premium valuations reflecting growth expectations. The 14.04x consolidated multiple suggests the market is pricing in continued strong growth, supported by the 26% AI-attributable revenue growth rate.

## Key Uncertainties and Sensitivity Analysis

Three critical uncertainties drive sensitivity in the analysis: (1) OpenAI's 2025 LTM revenue estimate of $12B (±20% = ±$2.4B) impacts EV/Revenue by ±0.47%; (2) CoreWeave's 2025 LTM EV estimate of $70B (±20% = ±$14B) impacts EV/Revenue by ±0.20%; and (3) internal revenue removal estimates of $9.8B (±20% = ±$2.0B) impact EV/Revenue by ±0.39%. These sensitivities are relatively modest, suggesting the consolidated metrics are reasonably stable despite estimation uncertainty.

## Conclusion

The AI bubble demonstrates strong fundamentals with revenue growth supporting valuation expansion. The premium EV/Revenue multiple reflects both the high-growth nature of AI businesses and market expectations for continued expansion. While private company estimates introduce uncertainty, sensitivity analysis indicates consolidated metrics remain stable. The bubble's growth trajectory, particularly in AI-attributable segments, supports current valuations, though investors should monitor whether revenue growth can sustain the premium multiples as the market matures.
